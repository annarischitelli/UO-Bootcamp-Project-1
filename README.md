# bootcamp-group_project-1

Group Team Members: Anna Rischitelli, Priya Anulacharam, Nataliia Sokolova, Vincent Durcan, and Shadia Duery

Business Questions:

Do rates of covid19 differ based on local policies implemented (where do we get data of locked down period)


Steps for Project Completion:

Datasources:

-John Hopkings University Covid19 data

Data Analysis:

- Compare the groups (before and after lockdown)
- We will compare data by county from two States that we know applied different Covid19 lockdown policies
- CA and TX
- We wil compare covid19 infections by country by populations bins
- We will include a heat map of counties by cases
- Timeframe: January - October
- Rate of infection (covid cases per day)
- Total number of covid19 cases per State per month

Requirements:

1) Create a dataframe that is separated by county and it is during our timeframe (Jan-Oct) (Nataliia)
2) Line graph, Time vs Covid cases (new-daily-cases) for both states (Priya) 
3) Line graph, Time vs Covid cases (total cases) for both states (Priya)
4) Create a dataframe of grouped bins of population (CA) (Shadia)
5) Create a dataframe of grouped bins of population (TX) (Shadia)
6) Use 4) and 5), create a bar chart for TX and CA that total case per population bin (Shadia)
7) Scatter plot for small county population for TX and CA (Anna)
8) Scatter plot for medium county population for TX and CA (Anna)
9) Scatter plot for large county population for TX and CA (Anna)
10) Identify locked down dates per state (Nataliia)
11) One heat maps by county with total number of covid cases (Nataliia)
12) Find a correlation or linear regression, peak dates, based on what are they correlated (pop density) (Vincent)



List of Visualizations:

- 1 heat map covid19 by county (total numbers of cases)
- 1 line graph of all daily cases per state overtime 
- 2 bar charts (CA, TX) grouped (bins) bar chart of total monthly cases per state (summing data)
- 1 boxplots per bin (small, medium, large counties), total covid19 cases between Jan-Oct

Tools:

- jupyter notebook
- csv file
- libraries
