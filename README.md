Group Team Members: Anna Rischitelli, Priya Anulacharam, Nataliia Sokolova, Vincent Durcan, and Shadia Duery

Business Questions:

Do rates of covid19 differ based on local policies implemented (where do we get data of locked down period)


Steps for Project Completion:

Datasources:

-John Hopkings University Covid19 data

Data Analysis:

- Compare the groups (before and after lockdown)
- we will compare data by county from two States that we know applied different Covid19 lockdown policies
- CA and TX
- we wil compare covid19 infections by country by populations bins
- we will include a heat map of counties by cases
- timeframe: January - October
- rate of infection (covid cases per day)
- total number of covid19 cases per State per month


List of Visualizations:

- 1 heat map covid19 by county (total numbers of cases)
- 1 line graph of all daily cases per state overtime 
- 2 bar charts (CA, TX) grouped (bins) bar chart of total monthly cases per state (summing data)
- 1 boxplots per bin (small, medium, large counties), total covid19 cases between Jan-Oct

Tools:

- jupyter notebook
- csv file
- libraries
