# bootcamp-group_project-1

Group Team Members: Anna Rischitelli, Priya Anulacharam, Nataliia Sokolova, Vincent Durcan, and Shadia Duery

Business Questions:

Do rates of covid19 differ based on local policies implemented (where do we get data of locked down period)


Steps for Project Completion:

Datasources:

-John Hopkings University Covid19 data
-County information and landsize for population density calculations

Data Analysis:

- Timeframe: January - October
- We will compare data by county from two States that we know applied different Covid19 lockdown policies: CA and TX
- Rate of infection (covid cases per day)
- Total number of covid19 cases per State per month
- Heat map of COVID cases per county (per state)
- Scatter plots that compare COVID per capita and population density by county (by state)


Visualizations:

- Heat Map 
- Scatter plot to show log relationships for Total Cases for CA & TX vs. Time
- Line graph of New Daily Cases for CA & TX vs. Time
- Scatter plot for CA - Population Density vs. COVID Cases per Capita w/ linear regression 
- Saatter plot for TX - Population Density vs. COVID Cases per Capita w/ linear regression

Tools:

- jupyter notebook
- csv file
- libraries
