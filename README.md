# bootcamp-group_project-1

Business Questions:

By city size in the West Coast, which cities had the highest and lowest rates per capita of covid19
Do rates of covid19 differ based on local policies implemented (where do we get data of locked down period)

Steps for Project Completion:

Datasources:

-John Hopkings University Covid19 data

Data Analysis:

- we will compare data by county from two States that we know applied different Covid19 lockdown policies
- CA and TX
- we wil compare covid19 infections by country by populations bins
- we will include a heat map of counties by cases
- timeframe: January - October
- rate of infection (covid cases per day)
- total number of covid19 cases per State per month


List of Visualizations:

- 1 heat map covid19 by county (total numbers of cases)
- 1 line graph of all daily cases per state overtime 
- 2 bar charts (CA, TX) grouped (bins) bar chart of total monthly cases per state (summing data)
- 1 boxplots per bin (small, medium, large counties), total covid19 cases between Jan-Oct

Tools:

- jupyter notebook
- csv file
- libraries
